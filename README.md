# Description
This website was made to give a user a way to search through foods to create a menu for dinner for one calendar week.  A user will search for any type of food and see 4 results.  Each result will show a photo and text decription of each food product.  The search results will also contain a selector box with a drop down menu for each day of the week.  The user can add a food to a particular day by using the drop down menu.  If a user wants more search results they may enter a new search or click on the "Next Results" button for four more results. A user can had exercises to each day of the week.  A user does this by clicking the "Choose a Workout" button.  This button will display four random exercise results.  Just like the food results a user can add exercises to each day of the week by using the drop down menu selector included with each exercise result.  Any time during the selection process a user can click on the save button on the bottom of a particular day to save their selections to local storage for that day.  A button has also been included to clear the day of all food and exercises and delete that information from local storage.
